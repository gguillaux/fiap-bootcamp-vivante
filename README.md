# fiap-bootcamp-vivante
This repo was created for a bootcamp organized by [FIAP](http://fiap.com.br/) university with partnership and sponsorship of [Vivante](https://vivante.com.br/), and was part of the MBA in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning curriculum.

## Outcome
Our project succeed to be ranked on the Top #6 works that were presented in the global ranking, and on the Top #3 from our MBA class.

## Proposed Solution
We have showed a way to created a back-end web-service that would queued and prioritize tickets for field workers, alongside with calculating a linear-regression to predict the estimated time of accomplishment of the field task.
